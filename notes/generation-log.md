# Generation Log

A chronological log of changes to the book. Append a row for every
generation pass, edit, or restructuring. Use this to:

- Track what was generated when, and by whom.
- Pin the toolchain versions used for builds.
- Document deliberate scope changes.

Format: one entry per change, newest at the bottom.

## Entries

## 2026-05-05 — Initial scaffolding

- **Author:** Initial author
- **Scope:** Whole repository.
- **Change:** Created the project structure described in
  `../README.md`. Wrote the root documents (`README.md`,
  `SUMMARY.md`, `BOOK_SPEC.md`, `STYLE_GUIDE.md`,
  `CHAPTER_TEMPLATE.md`, `CONVERSION.md`, `metadata.yaml`).
  Created skeleton files for all chapters in `book/`. Created
  placeholder example folders, build scripts, and note files.
- **Toolchain:** not yet pinned. Build will be exercised in a later
  pass.
- **Follow-ups:**
  - Drain `verification-needed.md` as version-sensitive chapters are
    generated (especially AWS, Kubernetes, Next.js, Angular, React,
    AI tooling, Node.js).

## 2026-05-05 — Structure review pass

- **Author:** Initial author
- **Scope:** Root documents and structural rules; no chapter content
  changed.
- **Change:**
  - Documented `book/26-glossary.md` as a chapter-level structural
    exception in `BOOK_SPEC.md` and `CHAPTER_TEMPLATE.md`. The
    glossary keeps the alphabetical entries section and is exempt
    from teaching-oriented sections (Mental Model, Theoretical
    Foundation, Trade-offs, Production Considerations, Interview
    Q&A, Tech Lead Checklist, Summary, Further Study).
  - Reconciled the recommended generation order in `README.md` with
    the in-chapter generation note in `book/00-introduction.md`
    (intro is now generated late so it can cite real chapters).
  - Added `CHAPTER_GENERATION_PROMPT.md` to enforce consistency
    across chapter generations, with target length and
    version-sensitivity inputs and a self-review checklist.
  - Added `.gitignore` for `build/`, OS junk (`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`),
    editor caches, and LaTeX intermediates.
  - Updated `README.md` to reference `CHAPTER_GENERATION_PROMPT.md`
    and `.gitignore`. Updated `CONVERSION.md` to drop the "if you
    initialize a git repo" hedge.
- **Toolchain:** not yet pinned.
- **Follow-ups:**
  - First chapter to generate: `26-glossary.md` as a stub, then
    `13-system-design.md`. See the "Recommended Chapter Generation
    Order" section in the README.
